## About

**abacus** is a web application for brain training via common simple arithmetic problems solving. It is implemented without any framework or library except my own lightweight vanilla package that probably could be just one among other source files of current sources.

By the way, there is [todo list](./TODO.md).

## Motivation

Just for fun. It's re-implementation of my old project.

## Usage

```
npm run bulid
npm start
google-chrome http://localhost:8000
```

or

```
npm run build
google-chrome build/index.html
```
